  <p>Hi <%= firstName %>,</p>
  <p>
    How are you? I'm doing well. It's been almost <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> 
<% if(numMonthsSinceContact == 1) { %>
    month
<% } else { %>
    months
<% } %> since we last talked. I'm currently learning to code full-time at <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com">Fullstack Academy</a> and enjoying my time. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations.

  <p>
    I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog, <a href="http://umacodes.tumblr.com/">Uma Codes</a>.<p>
    Check out my most recent posts:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><%= latestPosts[i].date %>: <a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </p>

    Talk soon,<br>
